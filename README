Genome Wide Association Study with SLOPE
-------------------------

Package geneSLOPE performes Genome-wide association study with SLOPE.
This study is split into three steps.

1. In the first step data is read using \pkg{\link{bigmemory}} package and immediatly
screened using marginal tests for each SNP
2. SNPs are clumped using correlations
3. SLOPE is performed on data where each clump has
one representative (therefore we ensure that variables in linear model
are not strognly correlated)

-------------------------

You can install the latest development version of the code using the `devtools` R package.

```R
# Install devtools, if you haven't already.
install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)
install_github("psobczyk/geneSLOPE")
```

Running GUI
-------------------------
