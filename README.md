**geneSLOPE** --- Genome Wide Association Study with SLOPE
-------------------------

Package **geneSLOPE** can be used to perform Genome-wide association study with 
[SLOPE](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/SortedL1/). 

Such an analysis  is split into three steps.

1. Data is read using *bigmemory* package and immediately screened using marginal tests for each SNP

2. SNPs are clumped based on correlations

3. SLOPE is performed on reduced data. Each clump is
represented by one SNP

-------------------------

### How do I get set up? ###

You can install the latest development version of the code using the `devtools` R package.

```R
# Install devtools, if you haven't already.
install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)
install_github("psobczyk/geneSLOPE")
```

-------------------------

* You might need to install package dependencies:
    * SLOPE
    * ggplot2
    * bigmemory
    * grid
* Read vignette to get familiar with basic usage


#### Running GUI ####

```R
library(geneSLOPE)
gui_geneSLOPE()
```

### Who do I talk to? ###
* If help provided in the package documentation does not solve your problem
